# Intro-Mechatronics-Projects
Welcome to my Introduction to Mechatronics repository where you can find all my original code for my class projects!

# Home Project #4 Loops & Functions 
The code found in the file named [HP_4.ino](https://github.com/stevenrodriguezz/Intro-Mechatronics-Projects-/blob/main/HP_4.ino) was utilized on an Arduino with an LCD display to calculate and display the results of a mathematical expression for a set of predefined values. It then computes and showcases the minimum and maximum values among the results, all while repeating this process in a loop.

During the LCD project I discovered the practical utility of Arduino's pinMode function which enabled the precise configuration of pin behavior by specifying parameters such as pin number and voltage state, while also realizing that these voltage states could be activated through the use of 'high' and 'low' settings, coupled with timed delays implemented via the delay function with millisecond inputs. The assignment wasnâ€™t overly difficult, but it required a solid understanding of Arduino programming and how to work with external components like LCD displays. Challenges could be overcome by carefully reviewing the code, troubleshooting any issues that arise, and referring to relevant documentation or examples for guidance.

# Home Project #5 Digital & Analog Inputs
This projects code can be found under [HP_5.ino](https://github.com/stevenrodriguezz/Intro-Mechatronics-Projects-/blob/main/HP_5.ino). It offers a hands-on exploration of interfacing physical switches and analog sensors with microcontrollers to display real-time data on an LCD screen, providing valuable insights into electronics, programming, and troubleshooting.

I have gained a better understanding of how physical switches can be interfaced with microcontrollers to provide digital inputs. Specifically, I learned how a button press can be translated into a digital signal (HIGH or LOW) that can be processed by a microcontroller.I learned how to connect a potentiometer to an analog input pin and convert the analog signal into a usable voltage value. This allowed me to understand the concept of analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) and how it can be applied in practical projects.I gained experience in identifying and resolving issues in electronic circuits and code. Troubleshooting skills are crucial for any electronics project, and I learned how to use techniques such as serial debugging to diagnose problems effectively.The difficulty of this assignment can vary depending on prior experience and familiarity with electronics and programming. For someone with little to no background in these areas, the assignment might be moderately challenging. However, with proper guidance and access to resources, it is certainly achievable.The assignment's complexity increases if additional features or requirements are added, such as debouncing the switch or implementing more advanced LCD features. Nonetheless, the assignment provides an excellent opportunity for hands-on learning and skill development.
